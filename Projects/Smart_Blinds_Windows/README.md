# Smart Window Blinds Project

## Overview

The Smart Window Blinds project presents an innovative solution for automating window blinds using environmental data. This system intelligently adjusts the blinds for optimal light and temperature, enhancing comfort and energy efficiency within indoor spaces.

## Features

- **Automated Adjustments:** Utilizes light and temperature sensors to automatically control the blinds' position.
- **Manual Override:** Allows manual control, enabling users to adjust the blinds to their preferences.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Optimizes the use of natural light, potentially reducing the need for artificial lighting and heating.

## Components

- Arduino UNO
- Light and temperature sensors
- DC motor with a custom 3D-printed motor shaft connector
- H-bridge motor driver
- Various electronic components (resistors, push buttons, etc.)

## Mechanical Design

The project includes a custom-designed motor shaft connector, allowing the motor to efficiently control the movement of the blinds. The connector is designed for durability and precision, ensuring reliable operation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Access to a 3D printer
- Basic electronic tools and supplies

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
https://github.com/Seyi-roboticist/OluwaseyiR.github.io

2. **Assemble the hardware components** as outlined in the provided assembly instructions within the repository.
3. **3D print the motor shaft connector** using the STL file located in the `3DModels` directory.
4. **Upload the control algorithm** to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

- The blinds automatically adjust based on the detected light and temperature.
- Use the manual override button to control the blinds' position as desired.
