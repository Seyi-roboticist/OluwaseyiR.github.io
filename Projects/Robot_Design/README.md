# ARM M1 Robotic Arm Design: Kinematics and Control

## Overview
The ARM M1 project stands as a significant personal achievement in the field of engineering, showcasing the practical applications of robotics. This project began with a unique 6-DOF robotic arm designed in SolidWorks and realized through both prototyping in PLA and final fabrication in aluminum.

## Fabrication Details

## Modifications and Refurbishment
I have refurbished a used Ender-3 printer to produce custom parts, ensuring high precision and fit for the robotic arm.

## Power Management
A custom-made PCB was designed for efficient power management, reducing wiring complexity and improving reliability.

## Kinematics
The algorithms for forward and inverse kinematics were developed and translated into embedded C++ code, which is a testament to the sophisticated control system of ARM M1.

## Next Steps
The project is progressing towards the completion of metal fabrication and the integration of mobility features.
