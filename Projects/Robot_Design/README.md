# ARM M1 Robotic Arm Design: Kinematics and Control

## Overview

The ARM M1 project represents a significant milestone in my engineering journey, embodying my most impactful personal project to date. This venture into robotics culminates in the creation of a highly practical, 6-DOF (degree of freedom) robotic arm, inspired by an initial hydraulic design and realized through the capabilities of SolidWorks. Transitioning from a PLA prototype to a refined aluminum construct, the ARM M1 stands as a testament to innovation and personalized engineering solutions.

## Project Highlights

- **Design and Fabrication**: The leap from a conceptual hydraulic model to a functional 6-DOF robotic arm, crafted using SolidWorks. The project saw the evolution of ARM M1 from a PLA prototype to its final aluminum incarnation, showcasing a blend of aesthetic design and practical functionality.
  
- **3D Printing Mastery**: Revitalization of a used Ender-3 printer, adapting and upgrading its components to facilitate the custom fabrication of ARM M1 parts. This step underscored the importance of adaptability and resourcefulness in personal engineering projects.

- **Innovative Power Management**: The development of a custom PCB for ARM M1, aimed at streamlining the power management system. This innovation significantly reduced the complexity and clutter of wiring, enhancing the system's efficiency and reliability.

- **Kinematics and Programming**: A self-taught journey through the realms of forward and inverse kinematics, utilizing online resources and platforms like YouTube. The algorithms developed from this learning process were meticulously coded in embedded C++, laying the groundwork for ARM M1's precise movement and control.

- **Future Directions**: The ongoing ambition to complete the metal fabrication of ARM M1 and introduce mobility to the robot's chassis. This next phase is poised to elevate the project, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in personal robotic design.

## Learning Outcomes

- Proficiency in SolidWorks for mechanical design and fabrication.
- Hands-on experience in 3D printing and printer modification.
- Custom PCB design for efficient power management.
- Application of forward and inverse kinematics in robotic control.
- Embedded C++ programming for robotics.

## Upcoming Features

- Completion of aluminum fabrication for enhanced durability and performance.
- Integration of a mobile chassis to expand the robot's operational capabilities.

## Current Challenges 
- Damage laptop 
	- Lack of Access to Certain 3D Parts: These components are absent but will be reprinted for additional revisions prior to the aluminum machining of the second robotic arm (Arm 2).
	- PCB Circuit Redesign: Necessity to reconstruct the PCB design from the beginning.

## Current Fabrication 
Before leaving Canada, I was able to find sometime to machine some of these parts which are shown here (The only missing part is the end-effector. There was some design challenges I had to take care of and so there's a slight modification in the final design machined parts.
