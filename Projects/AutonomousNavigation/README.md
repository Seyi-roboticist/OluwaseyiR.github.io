# Autonomous Navigation Robot

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an autonomous navigation robot capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles using a combination of sensors and intelligent algorithms. It integrates a Pixy2 camera for object and color detection, IR sensors for proximity sensing, and encoders for precise movement control.

### Developer

- Seyi R. Afolayan

### Features

- Object detection and color recognition with Pixy2 camera.
- Proximity detection with IR sensors.
- Precise movement and turning using motor encoders.
- Modular code design for easy expansion and maintenance.

### Hardware Components

- Arduino (Model: [Mega])
- DualMAX14870MotorShield
- Pixy2 Camera
- IR sensors
- Pololu-25D metal gearmotors with encoders
- DFRobot 65mm Rubber Wheel Pair - Blue

### Software Technologies

- Arduino IDE for development
- C/C++ for Arduino programming

## Getting Started
I will fill in this one I am done with the project by the end of nextweek.
